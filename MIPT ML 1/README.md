### Tasks from the Radoslav Neychev's ML course in MIPT. 

KNN, SVM, Linear regeression and Lab 1 -- Brief review of classic ML algorithms.

nn_from_scratch -- simple linear neural network on numpy

Lab 2 -- introduction to DL, dealing with overfitting, pytorch CNN models transfer learning and simplified usage of vanilla RNN and LSTM.

Triple input net -- simple net combining 3 different ones used for different features for better performance.

Word embeddings comparison -- simple LogReg classification using different embeddings, from BoW to pretrained w2v from gensim
